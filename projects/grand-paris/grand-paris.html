      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>The Société du Grand Paris is responsible for the Grand Paris Express, one of Europe’s largest infrastructure projects aimed at expanding the Paris metro network. This ambitious project requires transparent communication with the public and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has access to accurate, up-to-date information on its progress. The goal of this project was to design a website that would serve as a comprehensive resource for all users, from local residents to urban planning professionals.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem statement</h2>
      <p>The existing communication channels were fragmented and lacked a centralized platform where users could easily find relevant information about the project. The challenge was to design an intuitive, user-friendly website that could present complex data in a clear and accessible way while catering to a diverse audience with different levels of technical knowledge.</p>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>As the UX Designer, I led the user experience design process, focusing on understanding the needs of various user groups and ensuring that the website was both functional and easy to navigate. My approach involved several key phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Research & Discovery: I conducted user research through interviews and surveys with target users, including local residents, government officials, and project stakeholders. This helped identify key pain points and expectations.</li>
        <li>Personas & User Journeys: Based on research findings, I developed personas representing different user groups and mapped out their journeys to ensure that their needs were met at every interaction point.</li>
        <li>Wireframes & Prototyping: I created wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma, focusing on simplifying navigation and making complex information easy to digest. These prototypes were tested with real users to validate design decisions.</li>
        <li>Collaboration: I worked closely with visual designers and front-end developers to translate wireframes into high-fidelity designs. Throughout development, I ensured that accessibility standards (WCAG) were met, making the site usable for all audiences.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>The final solution was a responsive, accessible website that organizes information into clear sections based on user needs. The design features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplified Navigation: A clean, intuitive navigation system that allows users to quickly find relevant information about different aspects of the Grand Paris Express project.</li>
        <li>Content Hierarchy: A well-structured content layout that prioritizes essential updates while allowing users to dive deeper into more detailed reports or technical documents if needed.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: The site was designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring compliance with WCAG standards so that users with disabilities could easily navigate and interact with the content.</li>
      </ul>

      <div><img src="../../images/grand-paris-express/discover.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></div>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The website successfully launched as a central hub for all communication related to the Grand Paris Express project. It now serves as a key tool for public engagement, providing clear and accessible information about one of France’s most important infrastructure initiatives. The site has improved transparency by offering real-time updates, project timelines, environmental impact reports, and interactive maps.</p>
      <p>Key results include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased user engagement due to improved navigation and accessibility.</li>
        <li>Positive feedback from stakeholders about how easy it is to find critical project information.</li>
        <li>Enhanced public trust through transparent communication of progress.</li>
      </ul>
