      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Client:</strong> SFR (French telecommunications company - Business division)</p>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Senior UX Designer via Pocket Prod agency - Responsible for UX research, user interviews, workshop facilitation, wireframing, and co-design sessions</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> June 2022 - April 2023</p>
      <p><strong>Team:</strong> UX designers, UI designers, Product Owners, Technical Project Managers, Developers, and Customer Service representatives.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Methods:</strong> Figma, Miro, user interviews, co-design workshops, persona development, KPI prioritization exercises</p>
      <p><strong>Project Scale:</strong> B2B telecom management platform serving enterprise clients across France.</p>

      <h2>Challenge & Context</h2>
      <p>SFR's business client portal faced multiple challenges with outdated interfaces and limited functionality for enterprise customers managing complex telecom infrastructures. The platform included several critical areas needing redesign: the Billboard (expense tracking and reporting), incident ticketing system, and account management features. Business clients struggled with inefficient workflows, limited visibility into their telecom expenses, and aging UI that didn't meet modern B2B standards. The existing tools forced clients to rely heavily on ROCs (customer relationship officers) or external tools like Excel and SaasWeDo for critical reporting needs, indicating a significant gap between platform capabilities and user needs.</p>

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Redesign the Billboard to provide business clients with comprehensive, customizable expense tracking and KPI reporting</li>
        <li>Modernize the incident reporting system with improved UI and streamlined UX</li>
        <li>Enhance account management with complete visibility of user logins, admin privileges, and security monitoring</li>
        <li>Reduce client dependency on ROCs and external tools by making the platform more autonomous and user-friendly</li>
        <li>Align interface design with SFR Business digital charter</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Focus Areas / Research Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How do business clients currently track and analyze their telecom expenses?</li>
        <li>What KPIs are most critical for different user profiles (managers vs. administrators)?</li>
        <li>What should be included in free vs. premium tiers for advanced reporting features?</li>
        <li>How can we enable report customization while keeping the tool accessible?</li>
        <li>What security and activity tracking features do admins need for account management?</li>
        <li>How can ROCs be better supported as a user persona?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Research & Discovery</h2>
      <p><strong>Research Methods:</strong> Semi-structured user interviews, workshop-based co-design sessions, ROC consultation, competitive benchmarking.</p>
      <p><strong>Participants:</strong> Business clients for Billboard research, ROCs (Relationship Officers), and internal support team members.</p>
      
      <h3>Key User Profiles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manager/Gestionnaire:</strong> Adjusts budgets and monitors spending, needs high-level KPI visibility and trend analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> Manages user accounts, permissions, and security monitoring, needs detailed access logs and device activity tracking</li>
        <li><strong>ROC (Relationship Officer):</strong> Supports clients in using the platform, creates custom reports, needs professional tools to efficiently serve multiple clients</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>User Insights & Synthesis</h3>
      <p>The research revealed that business clients faced significant challenges in autonomously managing their telecom data. Many relied on ROCs or exported data to Excel for analysis, indicating the platform wasn't meeting their reporting needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pain Point 1:</strong> Clients cannot easily create custom reports tailored to their organizational structure without extensive ROC support</li>
        <li><strong>Pain Point 2:</strong> Critical KPIs are scattered across multiple interfaces with no clear prioritization or grouping</li>
        <li><strong>Pain Point 3:</strong> Account security and activity monitoring lacks visibility, making it difficult for admins to detect unusual access patterns or manage user permissions effectively</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Customer Needs</h2>
      <h5>Customizable reporting by organizational structure</h5>
      <p>Clients need to group and analyze telecom data by their own business entities (production, commercial, R&D departments) rather than just technical line groupings, enabling budget allocation and cost center management aligned with their company structure.</p>
      
      <h5>Prioritized, relevant KPIs with premium differentiation</h5>
      <p>Users need clear distinction between essential free KPIs and advanced premium features, with the ability to focus on the 3-10 most important metrics for their role rather than being overwhelmed by data.</p>
      
      <h5>Autonomous security and account management</h5>
      <p>Administrators need complete visibility of all admin and user accounts, recent login activity, device information, unusual access patterns, and the ability to take action without always requiring technical support.</p>

      <h2>Design Process & Approach</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery & Research:</strong> Conducted detailed user interviews, organized presentations with ROCs to gather market feedback, performed competitive analysis, and developed personas.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-Design & Ideation:</strong> Facilitated workshops for incident reporting and technical change screens. Held meetings for KPI deep-dives and prioritization exercises using sticky notes and dot voting.</li>
        <li><strong>Design & Iteration:</strong> Created wireframes and screen flows in Figma. Developed UI screens following SFR Business digital charter. Iterated designs based on workshop feedback and stakeholder input.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Solution & Key Features</h2>
      
      <h3>Billboard (Expense Tracking & Reporting)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customizable KPI Dashboard:</strong> Prioritized and grouped KPIs based on user role. Two-tier structure with free essential KPIs and premium advanced analytics. Custom report builder.</li>
        <li><strong>Organizational Grouping:</strong> Ability to group telecom lines by business entities. Support for holding company structures with multi-level views.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Account Management & Security</h3>

        <li><strong>Device Activity & Security Monitoring:</strong> Tracking of device type, OS, browser, location, and IP address. Detection of unusual access patterns. GDPR-compliant data handling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Incident Reporting</h3>
      <p>Modernized ticketing interface integrated with overall platform UI. Streamlined incident declaration process for mobile, fixed line, and cloud services.</p>

      <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balancing autonomous client use with ROC support model:</strong> Designed the tool to support both use cases, with ROCs able to help clients set up initial custom reports, adding value to the ROC service while enabling client independence over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium feature definition and value proposition:</strong> Used collaborative workshops and persona-based evaluation to identify truly advanced features (like adjustable out-of-plan tracking and zero-traffic line analysis) that justified premium pricing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Contribution & Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Led user research including conducting interviews with business clients</li>
        <li>Facilitated multiple co-design workshops with stakeholders and product owners</li>
